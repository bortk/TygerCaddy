Installer relies on files delivered via CDN
 - Ensure access to the following is allowed on your network:
   - bootstrapcdn.com
   - maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com
   - cloudflare.com
   - cdnjs.cloudflare.com
   - fonts.googleapis.com
   - gstatic.com
   - fonts.gstatic.com

Installer can be ran after first install
 - If you enter the same settings, it fails
   - Browsing to IP/dashboard works normally after a second install

all hosts must have proxy upon creation
 - First create a proxy, then make a host
